    introduction: [
        `Our foundation recently convened a vital webinar titled "Breast Cancer: Facts and Myths" to address the widespread misinformation that often delays diagnosis.`,
        "The webinar focused on the reality that knowledge is the first line of defense.",
        `We explored how cultural taboos and "urban legends" about the disease can create unnecessary fear, ultimately providing a safe space for participants to ask difficult questions and receive expert, science-backed answers.`,
    ],
    objective: [
        "Misconception Management: To debunk common myths, such as the belief that only those with family history are at risk or that underwire bras and antiperspirants cause the disease.",
        "Early Detection Advocacy: To emphasize the life-saving importance of regular screenings, including Mammograms and Clinical Breast Exams (CBE).",
        "Risk Factor Awareness: To educate the audience on non-hereditary risk factors like age, dense breast tissue, and lifestyle choices.",
        "Inclusion Education: To highlight that breast cancer is not gender-exclusive, ensuring men also understand their risks and symptoms."
    ],
    impact: [
        `The interaction during the session was profound. Participants from various backgrounds used the live chat to share myths they had grown up believing, which were systematically addressed by our guest specialists. This real-time "fact-checking" led to a visible surge in confidence among the attendees.`,
        `By bridging the gap between clinical facts and community beliefs, the event transformed passive listeners into active health ambassadors, ready to spread accurate information across their wider networks.`,
