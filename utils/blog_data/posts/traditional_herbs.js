                Everyone has a story, and here’s mine.
                <br />
                *“Drink This, It Will Flush Your System.”*
                <br />
                It was a rainy morning in Yaba. My cousin Ayo had been coughing nonstop. Auntie Sade
                arrived, armed with a plastic bottle of brown liquid.
                <br />
                “Drink this herbal mixture. It works fast,” she declared.
                <br />
                Ayo hesitated but obeyed. One gulp later, his face twisted in horror. Two hours after, he was
                sweating and sprinting to the toilet like an Olympic athlete. 😂
                <br />
                According to Auntie Sade, it worked. “The cough has reduced now!” she smiled. But nobody
                asked what was inside, how it was made, or if it was safe.
                <br />
                That’s the truth about many Nigerian homes ;*trust and tradition* are often our only
                prescriptions.
                <br />
                Herbal mixtures aren’t the enemy. They’re part of our heritage. Long before pharmacies, our
                ancestors used herbs to heal and stay well.
                <br />
                But not all herbal mixture is safe.
                <br />
                Today, many are:
                <br />
                1. *Unmeasured*– No dosage, risking overdose.
                <br />
                2. *Unregulated* – Often made in unhygienic places.
                <br />
                3. *Unknown*– Ingredients hidden, sometimes mixed with alcohol or harmful additives.
                <br />
                In trying to “flush” the body, we may harm vital organs like the liver and kidneys.
                The goal isn’t to reject tradition but to balance it with *science, safety, and sense.*
                <br />
                ✅ Consult a doctor.
                <br />
                ✅ Choose NAFDAC-approved products.
                <br />
                ✅ Know your ingredients.
                <br />
                ✅ Stop if symptoms persist.
                <br />
                Culture isn’t the problem. *Ignorance is.*
                <br />
                So next time someone says, “Just take small, you go dey alright,” pause.
                Ask. Think.
                <br />
                Your health deserves more than a bitter guess.
