            <p>What is Blood Pressure?</p>

            <p>
                
            </p>

            <p className="mt-3">
                Blood pressure is basically the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your blood
                vessels as your heart pumps.
            </p>

            <p>
                Think of it like water flowing through a pipe:
                <br />
                If the pressure is too high, the pipe (blood vessel) can get damaged.
                <br />
                If it’s too low, the water (blood) may not reach where it should.
                <br />
                It’s Measured as two numbers (e.g., 120/80 mmHg):
                <br />
                Top number (Systolic): Pressure when your heart beats.
                <br />
                Bottom number (Diastolic): Pressure when your heart rests between beats.
                <br />
                Normal = below 120/80 mmHg
                <br />
                Above that = your heart is working harder than it should
                <br />
                The higher it goes (and the longer it stays high), the more risk for heart attack, stroke, kidney problems
            </p>

                What Are We Looking At in terms of symptoms?
            </p>

            <p>
                Many have no symptoms. But warning signs: frequent headaches, visual disturbance,
                nosebleeds, fatigue. Stress about daily life (jobs, school) might be complicating thing
            </p>
