                Mr Adewunmi, a 62 year Old lecturer noticed a small lump under his left nipple, he brushed it
                off. “Men don’t get breast cancer,” he told himself. But the lump grew and so did his worry.
                Weeks later, his doctor confirmed the unthinkable: Breast cancer.

                He was stunned. Like most men, Adewunmi never imagined he could face it. Yet according to
                the National Breast Cancer Foundation, “All people, whether male or female, are born with
                breast tissue, and those cells can become cancerous.”

                <br />
                Breast cancer in men is rare but real about 1 in 1,000 men will develop it. It often appears after
                age 60 and can be linked to family history, obesity, radiation exposure, or genetic mutations like
                BRCA1 and BRCA2.

                <br />
                After surgery and treatment, he made it through and decided to speak out. “If I can get it, any
                man can,” he says. “Don’t ignore any lump or change. Get checked.”

                <span className="fsb">The Takeaway</span>
                <br />
                Breast cancer doesn’t have a gender.
                Early detection saves lives.
                <br />
                Real men check, too.
