                Your body has two types of immunity: innate and adaptive.
                <br />
                The innate immune system is the one that jumps into action instantly . The “first responders”
                that fight off germs even before you realize they’re there.
                <br />
                This is called innate immunity
                <br />
                It’s fast, automatic, and always working even when you’re asleep.
                <br />
                <br />
                Examples: Your skin stopping germs
                <br />
                • Tears washing out bacteria from eyes
                <br />
                • Nose hairs trapping dust in air
                <br />
                • Stomach acid killing germs
                <br />
                • Immune cells acting like soldiers
                <br />
                <br />
                Think of it as your body’s “security guard on duty 24/7.”
                <br />
                When your innate immunity is weak, you fall sick easily from:
                <br />
                ✔ minor colds
                <br />
                ✔ flu
                <br />
                ✔ stomach infections
                <br />
                ✔ skin infections
                <br />
                ✔ slow recovery
                <br />
                ✔ constant fatigue
                <br />
                <br />
                A strong innate immunity means:
                <br />
                ✨ fewer infections
                <br />
                ✨ more energy
                <br />
                ✨ faster healing
                <br />
                ✨ overall healthier life
                <br />
                <br />
                This immune system are a vital part of your body and should be cared for, boosted to keep you
                in good health.
