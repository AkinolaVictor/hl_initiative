                Understanding your cycle helps you know when everything is fine and when something needs attention.
                <br />
                <br />
                What a Normal Cycle Looks Like
                <br />
                Your menstrual cycle is the number of days from the first day of one period to the first day of the
                next.
                <br />
                <br />
                A healthy cycle usually:
                <br />
                • Lasts *21–35 days*
                <br />
                • Bleeding lasts *2–7 days*
                <br />
                • Flow can be light, moderate, or slightly heavy
                <br />
                • Cramps, bloating, mood changes and fatigue can happen
                <br />
                • Periods may vary slightly from month to month
                <br />
                <br />
                Normal looks different for each person. What matters is what’s typical for you.

                <span className="fsb">What’s Normal During Your Period</span>
                <br />
                It’s normal to experience:
                <br />
                • Mild–moderate cramps
                <br />
                • Headache or back pain
                <br />
                • Mood changes
                <br />
                • Acne breakouts
                <br />
                • Food cravings
                <br />
                • Breast tenderness
                <br />
                • Slight clots (small and occasional)
                <br />
                <br />
                These changes happen because your hormones rise and fall throughout the cycle.

                <span className="fsb">What’s NOT Normal</span>
                <br />
                Some symptoms are warning signs:
                <br />
                ⚠ Very heavy bleeding (soaking a pad/tampon every 1–2 hours)
                <br />
                ⚠ Period lasting more than 7–8 days
                <br />
                ⚠ Extremely painful cramps that stop your daily activities
                <br />
                ⚠ Bleeding between periods or after sex
                <br />
                ⚠ Cycles shorter than 24 days or longer than 38 days
                <br />
                ⚠ Going months without a period (not pregnant or breastfeeding)
                <br />
                <br />
                These may point to issues like fibroids, hormonal imbalance, thyroid problems, PCOS or
                endometriosis.

                <span className="fsb">Why Menstrual Health Matters</span>
                <br />
                Your menstrual cycle is a key sign of general health.
                <br />
                It reflects:
                <br />
                • Hormonal balance
                <br />
                • Stress Levels
                <br />
                • Nutrition
                <br />
                • Reproductive health
                <br />
                • Overall wellbeing
                <br />
                <br />
                Irregular or painful periods aren’t something to “endure”. They may signal underlying problems.

                <span className="fsb"></span>
                <br />
                • Change pads/tampons regularly
                <br />
                • Wash hands before and after changing products
                <br />
                • Use warm compress for cramps
                <br />
                • Wear breathable underwear
                <br />
                • Stay active — gentle exercise reduces cramps

                • Don’t ignore severe pain
