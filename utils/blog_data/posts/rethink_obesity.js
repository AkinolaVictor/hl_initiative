                    Health Organization, childhood obesity has quadrupled since 1990, and adults living with
                    obesity have more than doubled. Doctors warn us that excess weight raises the risk of heart

                <p>
                    The body positivity movement began as a way to fight discrimination and unfair beauty
                    standards. It has helped people who felt excluded to build confidence and has reduced some of
                    the shame linked with weight. On social media, the movement spread quickly, encouraging
                    self-love and representation for all body types. Many people say body positivity has improved
                    their mental health, self-esteem and sense of belonging.
