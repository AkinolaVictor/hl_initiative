                Ever notice how some places just *drain* you…
                <br />
                and others make you feel calm?
                <br />
                <br />
                Not village people.
                <br />
                Not vibes.

                <span className="fsb">Your environment</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                Your surroundings affect:
                <br />
                <br />
                * How well you sleep
                <br />
                * How calm you feel
                <br />
                * How often you fall sick
                <br />
                <br />
                Health isn’t only about medicine.
                <br />
                It’s also about where you live and work.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Air We Breathe
                <br />
                <br />
                That tired feeling inside:
                <br />
                <br />
                * Packed buses
                <br />
                * Small shops with no windows
                <br />
                * One-room spaces with everyone inside
                <br />
                <br />
                It’s not laziness.It’s stale air stressing your body.
                <br />
                <br />
                Light & Mood
                <br />
                <br />
                Staying indoors all day with:
                <br />
                <br />
                * Curtains drawn
                <br />
                * Generator noise outside
                <br />
                * Little or no sunlight
                <br />
                <br />
                Your mood drops quietly.
                <br />
                Your body needs light—real light.
                <br />
                Noise Is Everyday Stress
                <br />
                <br />
                Traffic horns.
                <br />
                Neighbour’s TV on full volume.
                <br />
                Generator humming since morning.
                <br />
                <br />
                You may be used to it—
                <br />
                your body is not.
                <br />
                <br />
                Constant noise = constant stress.
                <br />
                <br />
                Cleanliness Hits Different
                <br />
                Blocked gutters.
                <br />
                Standing water.
                <br />
                Overfilled bins nearby.
                <br />
                <br />
                It’s not just unpleasant—
                <br />
                it increases germs, infections, and sickness around you.
                <br />
                <br />
                You don’t need a perfect environment.
                <br />
                <br />
                Just:
                <br />
                <br />
                * More fresh air
                <br />
                * Better light
                <br />
                * Cleaner spaces
                <br />
                * Less noise where possible
                <br />
                <br />
                *Small changes. Real impact.*
