                    Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders affecting
                    people with ovaries. It impacts how the ovaries work and can influence reproductive health,
                    metabolism, and overall well-being. While there’s no cure, PCOS can be effectively managed
                    with the right approach and lifestyle changes.

                <p className="font-semibold mt-7 mb-3">What is PCOS?</p>

                <p>
                    PCOS stands for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a hormonal imbalance that affects the release of
                    eggs from the ovaries. PCOS does not necessarily imply that there are cysts on the ovaries.
                    Under normal circumstances, during ovulation an egg is released each month. In PCOS,
                    ovulation can be irregular or absent, making it harder to conceive naturally. PCOS is also linked
                    to metabolic challenges, making it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it.

                <p className="font-semibold mt-7">Causes of PCOS</p>

                <p className="my-4">
                    While the exact cause of PCOS is not fully understood, research has shown that it results from a
                    combination of factors:
                </p>

                <p className=""><span className="font-semibold mb-3">1. Genetics:</span> PCOS can run in families. If a close family member has it, your risk is higher</p>
                <p className=""><span className="font-semibold mb-3">2. Insulin resistance:</span>  When the body’s cells don’t respond properly to insulin, the body produces more insulin, which can trigger higher androgen (male hormone) levels.</p>
                <p className=""><span className="font-semibold mb-3">3. Hormonal imbalance:</span> This often involves higher than normal androgens or lower progesterone levels, affecting ovulation.</p>
                <p className=""><span className="font-semibold mb-3">4. Environmental Factors:</span> Diet, stress, and lifestyle may influence symptoms.</p>

                
                <p className="font-semibold mt-7">Symptoms of PCOS</p>

                <p className="my-4">
                    PCOS symptoms often begin around puberty, but they can also start later, even into the early
                    twenties. Symptoms may vary from person to person. A diagnosis is usually made when at least
                    two of the following are present:

                <p className="mt-3">"PCOS means you can’t get pregnant." ❌</p>
                <p className="">
                    Many people with PCOS do conceive — either naturally or with medical assistance. It may take
                    more time and support, but it’s not impossible.
                </p>

                <p className="mt-3">"It only affects women who are overweight" ❌</p>
                <p className="">
                    PCOS can affect people of all body types. However, excess weight may worsen symptoms.
                </p>

                <p className="mt-3">"It’s caused by eating too much sugar" ❌</p>
                <p className="">
                    Diet can influence symptoms, but it’s not the root cause.
                </p>

                <p className="mt-3">"Irregular periods always mean PCOS" ❌</p>
                <p className="">

                <p className="">
                    Weight loss may improve symptoms, but PCOS is a lifelong condition with no known cure.

                <p className="font-semibold mt-7">Managing PCOS</p>
                
                <p className="">
                    While there’s no cure, symptoms can be managed effectively. Treatment depends on your
                    symptoms, goals (such as fertility), and overall health.

                    PCOS is a lifelong hormonal condition, but it doesn’t have to control your life. Early diagnosis,
                    healthy lifestyle choices, and the right medical guidance can help you manage symptoms,
                    reduce complications, and live a healthy, fulfilling life.
