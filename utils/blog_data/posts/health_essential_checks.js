                Regular health checks are a key part of preventive healthcare. They help detect diseases early,
                when treatment is easier and more effective. In many cases, these screenings can even prevent
                the development of severe conditions by identifying risk factors before symptoms appear.

                <br />
                <span className="fsb">-Blood Pressure:</span> High blood pressure is often called a “silent killer” because it usually has no
                symptoms. Regular monitoring helps prevent heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems.
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">-Blood Sugar (Glucose Test):</span> Checking fasting blood sugar or HbA1c levels helps detect
                diabetes or prediabetes early, reducing the risk of complications.
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">-Cholesterol (Lipid Profile):</span> Measuring total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides helps
                assess your risk for heart disease.

                <span className="fsb">-Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference:</span> These simple checks identify obesity and

                can give appropriate advice.
                <br />
