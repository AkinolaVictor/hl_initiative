                How It Affects Us
                <br />
                Long hours on phones or computers can cause blurred vision, headaches, irritability, and
                difficulty focusing. It can also make daily tasks feel more stressful.

                Blue Light and Sleep
                <br />
                Screens emit blue light that disrupts melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep. This can lead
                to restlessness and fatigue. Using blue light glasses, filters, or night mode can reduce its
                impact.

                Causes of Screen Fatigue
                <br />
                Glare from bright screens, poor lighting, bad posture, uncorrected vision, and long hours without
                breaks all contribute.

                <br />
                Symptoms to Watch For
                <br />
                Common signs include dry or watery eyes, headaches, sore neck or shoulders, and general
                discomfort.
                <br />
                <br />
                How to prevent it
                <br />
                Set up your workspace properly: keep your screen a few inches below eye level, maintain good
                posture, and rest your wrists while typing.
                <br />
                Follow the 20-20-20 rule:For every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Reduce glare
                by adjusting lighting and screen position.
                <br />
                <br />
                Beyond Screens
                <br />
                Take regular breaks to read, cook, or spend time outdoors to give your eyes and mind a reset.
                <br />
                <br />
                Final Tip
                <br />
                Get your eyes checked regularly. Small adjustments and good habits can protect your vision,
                improve focus, and help you feel more energised
