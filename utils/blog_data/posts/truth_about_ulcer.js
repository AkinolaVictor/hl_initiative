                "Ulcer isn’t just caused by skipping meals!”
                <br />
                Let’s clear some myths and uncover the real truth about stomach ulcers.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">The Common Misconception</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                You’ve probably heard: “Ulcer comes from hunger or stress.”
                <br />
                <br />
                But guess what?
                <br />
                <br />
                That’s only <span className="fsb">half true!</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                Ulcers are not just about what (or when) you eat , they’re about *what’s happening inside your
                body.*
                <br />
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">The Real Cause:</span>
                <br />
                Most ulcers are caused by a *bacterium called *Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)*.*
                It weakens your stomach lining, allowing acid to create sores.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">Other triggers? Yes</span>
                <br />
                * Excess use of painkillers (like ibuprofen)* Smoking or alcohol
                <br />
                * High stress levels
                <br />
                * Skipping meals *consistently* (not occasionally)
                <br />
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">How It Feels:</span>
                <br />
                Ulcers don’t always mean severe pain.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">It can come in signs like:</span>
                <br />
                * Burning or dull stomach pain
                <br />
                * Nausea or bloating
                <br />
                * Loss of appetite
                <br />
                * Heartburn or vomiting
                <br />
                <br />
                If you have these often, it’s time to check in with a doctor and not just self-medicate.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">Treatment Truth:</span>
                <br />
                Ulcers can *heal completely* with proper care!
                <br />
                ✅ Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics (to kill H. pylori)
                <br />
                ✅ Antacids or acid blockers (to reduce acid)
                <br />
                ✅ And of course ; lifestyle adjustments like balanced meals and less caffeine.
                <br />
                <br />
                🚫 Don’t rely on random herbal mixes or soda remedies, they can worsen it!
                <br />
                <br />
                <span className="fsb">What to Eat & Avoid:</span>

                <br />

                <br />
                ❌ Soda does not cure ulcer pain , it can make it worse.
                <br />

                <br />
